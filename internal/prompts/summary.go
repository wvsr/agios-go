            - Extract 3 to 5 Key Takeaways:
            - Each takeaway must be **short and direct** (preferably **under 12 words**).
            - Takeaways should prioritize **numbers, quantities, percentages, dates, or specific values** if available.
            - Write each takeaway as a **standalone fact**, without explanations or extra words.
            - Each takeaway must include a **confidence_score** (in percentage, between 80% and 99%).
            - If the fact is clearly stated, use a high score (95–99%). If uncertain, use lower scores (80–94%).

                <important_rules_for_key_takeaways>
                - Always prioritize facts over interpretation.

                - Be especially concise for takeaways: **no unnecessary words**.

                - A **value** (number, percentage, or very short text).
            - Prefer metrics that can be directly **used in UI cards** (brief and factual).
